    "descmd" : "This profile defines how to enable the sharing of non-patient files.

    Those files can be created, consumed and updated by many different
    systems involved in a wide variety of data sharing workflows (clinical
    workflow definition, domain policies sharing, stylesheets management,
    etc.). This profile identifies three actors: File Manager, File
    Consumer, and File Source. To fulfill use-case requirements, this
    profile defines four new transactions (Submit File ITI-87, Search
    File ITI-88, and Update DocumentReference ITI-89) and Retrieve File ITI-109.
    
    There are IHE profiles that define the content of files that are not
    patient-related; this profile does not require that the actors be able
    to process the contents of the files being shared. Understanding this
    profile does not require the knowledge of the files shared.
    
    The NPFS Profile specifies transactions for the sharing of files. Any
    file type can be shared using this profile; however, specific guidance
    is given for three types of files:
    
    - Workflow Definitions: files which define the processing rules for a
      specific clinical/administrative workflow (see [ITI TF-1: 30.4.1.1 “XDW Workflow Architecture”](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-30.html#30.4.1.1) for additional information).
    
    - Privacy Domain Policies: files which describe a specific privacy
      policy that applies to, or may be agreed by the patient (see [ITI TF-1: 19.2 “Creating Patient Privacy Policies”](https://profiles.ihe.net/ITI/TF/Volume1/ch-19.html#19.2) for further details).
    
    - Stylesheets: structured documents used by user-agents (e.g., Web
      Browsers) to render the content of an XML document.
    
    Local policies may extend the types of files shared using NPFS and that
    can be classified using the metadata model described in this profile.",
